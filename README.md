Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a group that is making a game called Draw It or Lose It. The game requires players to correctly guess the image pulled from a large library of stock drawings as clues. They wanted the game to be cross platform and run on all platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a great job explaining the technical aspects of the project in layman's terms for the client to understand and comparing and contrasting the differences between operating systems and eventually recommending which OS we should go with.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
By far the most helpful part of the design document was the UML Diagram since it told me exactly every single thing that needed to be included in each object and how those objects and classes were related to each other. This made writing the code much much easier.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably revise the Security part in the Recommendation section. I don’t think that I delved deep enough and could have made it a lot more detailed. However I think I did a fine job with explaining it in a way that everyone could understand.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user is the person who is going to play the game, so I will create the game for the user. If I don’t listen to the user’s needs, then they simply won’t enjoy the game. If I want people to play the game, then I should listen to as many users as I can and tweak different aspects of the game to improve it for the audience that it is designed for.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When I design software I first check the requirements on what needs to be done, then check who the audience is. If there are certain things that must be fulfilled, then those need to be accounted for first. For example, the client requested for at least one or more teams to be created with multiple players on it, amongst other requirements. Once the clients requirements are met, then we look at the user needs. I think starting with the requirements is the best way to ensure you make the client happy and complete the project.
